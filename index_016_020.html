      <h2>Day 16</h2>

      <h3>Reading</h3>
        <ul class ="square">
          <li>We're starting a new novel this week: <em>The Night Parade</em> by Kathryn Tanquary.  It is a fantasy book that spotlights Japanese mythology.</li>
          <li>Begin by reading this <a href="http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/Iz-Le/Japanese-Mythology.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview</a> of Japanese mythology. A copy of the text is in your folder.</li>
          <li>You don't need to memorize names or details, but be sure to note the general idea of the stories.  Most important of all, notice the differences and similarities between these myths and those of Greek and Roman traditions.</li>
          <li>Start reading <em>Night Parade</em>: Chapters 1 - 4, pp. 1- 61.</li>
          <li>When a book belongs to a school or library or if it's a nice copy, you shouldn't make any marks, but in this case, since this copy is yours, feel free to make notes in the margins and highlight passages that stand out to you. This will help you recall important information later on.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Words of the Day:</h3>
      <p>Write the two words below in your vocabulary book along with their short definitions. Also, click on the link for each word, and read more about the definition.</p>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/deride" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deride</a> - treat or speak of with contempt</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/despot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despot</a> - a cruel and oppressive dictator</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reading - Poetry</h3>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li>Read <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43687/the-tyger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Tyger</em></a> by William Blake.</li>
        <li>Summary: The poem begins with the speaker asking a fearsome tiger what kind of divine being could have created it: &quot;What immortal hand or eye/ Could frame they fearful symmetry?&quot; Each subsequent stanza contains further questions, all of which refine this first one. From what part of the cosmos could the tiger’s fiery eyes have come, and who would have dared to handle that fire? What sort of physical presence, and what kind of dark craftsmanship, would have been required to &quot;twist the sinews&quot; of the tiger’s heart? The speaker wonders how, once that horrible heart &quot;began to beat,&quot; its creator would have had the courage to continue the job. Comparing the creator to a blacksmith, he ponders about the anvil and the furnace that the project would have required and the smith who could have wielded them. And when the job was done, the speaker wonders, how would the creator have felt? &quot;Did he smile his work to see?&quot; Could this possibly be the same being who made the lamb?</li>
        <li>Using the printout of this poem, outline each word you don't know, then look up the word on the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online dictionary.</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Writing</h3>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li>Write a one-sentence summary of each stanza. Look up any words you don't know. For example, a &quot;bleeding heart&quot; is like a &quot;saddened heart.&quot;</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Computer</h3>
      <p>Starting today, we'll be learning computer terms and simple programming.</p>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li>Computer term of the day: What is a <strong>cache</strong>?</li>
        <li>Your browser’s <strong>cache</strong> (pronounced &quot;cash&quot;) is a memory of a website. You can view the <strong>cache</strong> of a webpage even if you aren’t connected to the internet. It won’t be updated. It will be an old image of that webpage. Some browsers use the <strong>cache</strong> to open web pages more quickly by bringing up a previous version of the page. If you expect a change on a page and you reload it but don’t see the change, it’s like that you are seeing an older version of the page from the cache. If you need to see the change on the page, you can try and hit (CTRL and F5). If that doesn’t work go to your browser’s tools or settings and look for a clear cache option.</li>

      <h3>Reading</h3>
        <ul class ="square">
          <li>Continue reading <em>The Night Parade</em> by Kathryn Tanquary: Chapters 9 - 12, pp. 121 - 188.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Grammar - Review: Simile and Metaphor</h3>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li><strong>Similes</strong> and <strong>metaphors</strong> are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.</li>
        <li>A <strong>simile</strong> compares two things by saying that one is like the other. <strong>Similes</strong> often use the words <strong>like</strong> and <strong>as</strong>:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>My sister runs like a cheetah.</li>
            <li style="list-style: none;"><em>The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word <strong>like</strong>. A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.</em></li>
            <li>The cat's fur was as dark as the night.</li>
            <li><em>The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word <strong>as</strong>.</em></li>
            <li><em>The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.</em></li>
          </ul>
          <li>A <strong>metaphor</strong> compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike <strong>similes</strong>, metaphors don't use the word <strong>like</strong> or <strong>as</strong>.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The snow formed a blanket over the town.</li>
            <li><em>The snow and a blanket are compared without the word <strong>like</strong> or <strong>as</strong>.</em></li>
            <li><em>A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.</em></li>
          </ul>
          <li>Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.</li>
          <li>Try these <a href="https://www.ixl.com/ela/grade-5/identify-similes-and-metaphors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">practice exercises.</a></li>
