      <h3>Reading</h3>

        <li>Background: During the Medieval Era, there was yet another New Year's resolution tradition, known as the <em>Vow of the Peacock</em>, that has fallen out of practice in modern times. In Charles Dickens’ periodical <em>All the Year Round</em>, he wrote about the <em>Vow of the Peacock</em>, explaining that peacocks (and occasionally pheasants) represented &quot;by the splendour and variety of their colours, the majesty of kings during the middle ages&quot; and were thought to be &quot;the peculiar diet of valiant knights and heart-stricken lovers.&quot; Therefore, in the new year, a great feast was held with a roasted peacock as its centerpiece. Each knight would make a vow of chivalry to the bird, after which it would be carved and divided among all those present. The code of chivalry, which knights in question pledged to uphold, can be found <a href="http://wwwcdn.writersdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/5058440.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Write a short story that begins as follows: <em>At the stroke of midnight on January 1, 2028, you are enjoying your celebration with friends and not giving much thought to tomorrow. Suddenly, you notice that there is a large peacock standing beside you. You're not quite sure where it came from, or if the bird is even real. The peacock cranes its slender neck to look up at you, then politely asks if you intend to uphold the code of chivalry and make the <em>Vow of the Peacock</em> in the new year.</em> What do you do?</li>
