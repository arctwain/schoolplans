      <h3>Reading</h3>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li>Today we'll start our study of classic horror tales.  Every day this week you'll be reading a short story from a different author.</li>
        <li>Next week we'll begin a new book.</li>
        <li>Read <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/poe/cask.html">The Cask of Amontillado</a> by Edgar Allan Poe.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Computer</h3>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li>Another piece to your browser’s memory is called <strong>cookies</strong>. Cookies are what enable your browser to remember your usernames and passwords and what things you normally search for; also enables stores to follow what pages you look at on their websites to know what you might be interested in. Yes, it's also a way for websites to collect information on your activities! Finding and clearing cookies are different for every browser. For the Edge browser, the steps are:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Open Microsoft Edge.</li>
          <li>Click on More options (… symbol) on the top right corner of the browser.</li>
          <li>Select Settings from the drop down menu.</li>
          <li>Click on Choose what to clear under</li>
          <li>Clear browsing data.</li>
          <li>Check the Cookies and saved website data (and any other data you want to clear) and click on Clear button.</li>
        </ol>

        <li><strong>Warning</strong>: You'd think that it would be a good idea to clear your cookies, and it is, but remember that, if you delete all of your cookies, sites won’t remember your usernames and passwords for you anymore. We get so used to having them filled in for us that we forget what they are. If the computer isn't yours, don’t delete anything without permission.</li>
        <li>Watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBARzKRGLoM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Is Code?</a></li>
        <li>This week you'll begin to learn about <strong>HTML</strong>, which is short for &quot;HyperText Markup Language.&quot; That may sound scary, but it simply means it is a language for describing web pages using ordinary text. <strong>HTML</strong> is not a complex programming language.</li>
        <li>Every web page is actually an <span class="underline">HTML file</span>. Each HTML file is just a plain-text file, but with a .html file extension instead of .txt, and is made up of many HTML tags as well as the content for a web page.  A web site will often contain many html files that link to each other. You can edit HTML files with your favorite editor.</li>
        <li><span class="underline">HTML tags</span> are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content.</li>
        <li>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbLjmCc15M4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML Overview</a>.</li>

        <li>Multiplying by 10 is easy: 1 x 10 = 10, 2 x 10 = 20, 3 x 10 = 30, etc.</li>
        <li>You can multiply by 11 and 12 using the method we learned to multiply by a 2-digit number, but it will be useful to you if you memorize these tables as well.</li>
        <li>Multiplying by 11 is easy, too: 1 x 11 = 11, 2 x 11 = 22, 3 x 11 = 33, etc. The only ones that are tricky are 11 x 11 = 121 and 12 x 11 = 132.</li>

As you copy, try to memorize each one.  The worksheet is in your folder.</li>
