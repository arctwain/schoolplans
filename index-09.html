    <section><!-- Day 36 -->
      <h2>Day 36</h2>

      <h3>Reading</h3>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li>Finish reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1984</a> by George Orwell.</li>
        <li>Cliffs Notes is a well-known series of study guides; it helps people understand literature better.</li>
        <li>Read the following Cliffs Notes sections for the novel:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/n/1984/1984-at-a-glance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1984 at a Glance</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/n/1984/about-1984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About 1984</a></li>
            <li>As you read in the section above, Orwell wrote this novel right after World War II ended. We will study World War II later on this school year, but here is a brief summary: World War II (WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war. It took place between 1939 to 1945. Most of the world’s countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. The war was fought as a &quot;total war,&quot; meaning all resources a country had were used in the war, even those that didn’t belong to the army, such as factories. It involved more countries, cost more money, and killed more people than any other war in human history. Between 50 and 70 million people died. To put that number in perspective, the current population of the entire United Kingdom is approximately 64.1 million people. The death toll in World War II is equivalent to every single person in the United Kingdom losing their lives.</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/n/1984/study-help/quiz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quiz</a></li>
            <li>Note: This is a difficult quiz! Do your best, but don't worry if you don't do well.  Like all good literature, this novel is worthy of reading more than once.  At different times in your life, you will have new insights into the novel's meaning.</li>
