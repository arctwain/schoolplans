      <h2>Day 11</h2>

      <h3>Reading</h3>
      <ul class ="square"> 
        <li>Continue reading <em>Persepolis</em> by Marjane Satrapi.</li>
        <li>Read Chapters 23 - 25 today.</li>
        <li>After you are done with the reading, read the <a href="https://www.shmoop.com/persepolis/chapter-23-summary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online summary and quotes</a> for each chapter. The links are on the left side of the page.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Words of the Day:</h3>
      <p>Write the two words below in your vocabulary book along with their short definitions. Also, click on the link for each word, and read more about the definition.</p>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/coerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coerce</a> - to cause to do through pressure or necessity</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/coherent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coherent</a> - marked by an orderly and consistent relation of parts</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reading - Poetry</h3>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li>Read <a href="http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/187/lyrics-of-lowly-life/3773/october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;October&quot;</a>; answer the following questions in your notebook:</li>
        <li>This poem is about what? Hint: Look at the title.</li>
        <li>The poet doesn’t just say, &quot;This is what October is like.&quot; How does he talk about October?</li>
        <li>This is called <strong> anthropomorphism</strong> (an-thro-po-morph-ism), an interpretation of what is not human or personal (like October) in terms of human or personal. What are some things October does in this poem that make “her” like a human?</li>
        <li>Notice that this word is from the Greek: anthropos (meaning man or human being) + morphos (meaning shape or form).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Writing</h3>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li>The easiest example of anthropomorphism is any cartoon where an animal acts like it's a person.</li>
        <li>The easiest way to write a story with <strong>anthropomorphism </strong>is to use the word &quot;I.&quot;</li>
        <li>Write a short <em>Who Am I?</em> story. Here’s an example: <em>I sit all day helping others sit. You get to stand and stretch your legs, but I am stuck sitting, sitting, sitting. And not only that, but I give you a nice soft place to sit, and what do I get to sit on? The hard floor! Is that fair?  (Who am I?)</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Math</h3>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li>Watch: <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/addition-subtraction/v/negative-numbers-introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Negative Numbers Introduction</a></li> 
        <li>Complete the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/absolute-value/add-sub-negatives/e/number_line_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exercise</a>.</li>
        <li>Adding positive and negative numbers. Do these exercises in your notebook:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>8 + 3 = ?</li>
          <li>-8 + -3 = ?</li>
          <li>-8 + 3 = ?</li>
          <li>8 + -3 = ?</li>
          <li>11 + 9 = ?</li>
          <li>-11 + 9 = ?</li>
          <li>11 + -9 = ?</li>
          <li>-11 + -9 = ?</li>
        </ol>
      </ul>

      <h3>Science</h3>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li>Last week we learned about the <strong>Scientific Method</strong>.  Here is a <a href="https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/science-fair/steps-of-the-scientific-method" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">review page</a> on this topic. We'll be referring to this when we do our weekend experiments.</li>
        <li>Write the following in your notebook with today's date:</li>
        <li>This week's topic: What is a <strong>habitat</strong>?</li>
        <ol>
          <li>A habitat is a place where an organism lives.</li>
          <li>There are six different habitats: polar, desert, freshwater, rainforest, forest, and ocean.</li>
          <li>Habitats are in different parts of the world.</li>
          <li>Some habitats have mountains and rocks; others have snow and ice.</li>
          <li>Living things adapt to their habitat and depend on it for survival.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/earth-habitats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a> about types of habitats. They're all covered except for polar.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Grammar</h3>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li>All about sentences:</li>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Subject</strong> is what the sentence is about. The simple subject is the noun; it's <em>cup</em> instead of <em>the blue cup</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Predicate</strong> is the rest of the sentence, what the subject does. The simple predicate is the verb; it&#8217;s <em>ran</em> instead of <em>ran all the way home</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Imperative</strong> sentences give a command. <strong>Declarative</strong> sentences make a statement. <strong>Interrogative</strong> sentences ask a question. <strong>Exclamatory</strong> sentences exclaim.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Do your best with this <a href="http://eduplace.com/cgi-bin/schtemplate.cgi?template=/rdg/hme/quizzes/5/unit1.thtml&amp;grades=k_5&amp;alt=K-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sentence quiz</a>. We will review the answers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Art</h3>
      <ul class ="square">
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5mGeR4AQdM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Listen</a> to the story <em>The Dot</em> by Peter Reynolds. It is a story about believing in yourself and in your artwork.</li>
        <li>Then, create an image starting with only &quot;one dot&quot; on your paper. You can create your dot into whatever they want and should just let you intuition guide you. Do not use pencil. Start right away with permanent markers, since there can be no &quot;mistakes&quot; in this project. After completing your drawing, fill in color with pencils.</li>
        <img class="example" src="images/thedot_350.jpg" alt="The Dot Art Project Example">
        <li>Above is an example of a finished piece.  Yours should look completely different!</li>
